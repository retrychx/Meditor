MEditor is an **agent-native document workstation for people who write technical docs** on macOS. The core loop: **the Agent edits your document → the preview renders it instantly → you iterate together**.

Point it at a code repo or workspace and let the Agent do the writing engineers actually need — weekly reports, design proposals, changelogs, API references, meeting notes.

Pure SwiftUI + AppKit — **no Electron**. Bring-your-own-key — **your documents and your model credentials never leave your machine**.

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 A real Agent, not a chat box

- **14 tools, multi-turn loop** — The Agent reads, writes, patches, and searches documents; operates workspace files; drives the editor; and runs sandboxed shell commands — reasoning across tool calls until the job is done
- **Three backends** — OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic (9 built-in presets: Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, OpenRouter, Groq, Ollama), plus a local Claude CLI backend that reuses your Claude Code login
- **BYOK** — Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works; keys stay in your local Keychain
- **Streaming everywhere** — Responses stream token-by-token; tool steps render inline with expand/collapse detail

### 🛡 Built to be trusted with your files

- **Write confirmation** — The Agent asks before writing files; "allow all for this run" when you're in flow
- **Risk-tiered command sandbox** — Shell commands are classified by risk before execution
- **Context budget** — Token budget with automatic eviction keeps long sessions on track; stall detection stops runaway loops; read-only tools run in parallel
- **Observable runs** — Token usage and elapsed time shown per run
- **Inline diff review** — Agent edits land as reviewable diffs that never clobber your own typing; `@mention` pulls files into context; multi-session history keeps every conversation

### ⚡ AI woven into the writing flow

- **Slash commands** — Type `/` in the editor to pull up `/ask` `/polish` `/outline` `/translate` `/summary` `/fix` `/table` and more; commands that rewrite your document stream their changes as a diff you confirm before anything lands
- **Selection action bar** — Select text and a floating bar offers rewrite / tighten / expand / translate (select a list and it can become a table); Esc dismisses
- **Context automation** — Conversations auto-attach the current document (removable chip in the composer, can be disabled in Settings); when over budget it's smartly trimmed to the cursor's neighborhood plus head and tail
- **Diagnostics → one-click fix** — The diagnostics panel and pre-export checks offer "Let Agent fix it"; the model repairs, then re-scans so you can compare

### 🔄 The loop: edit → render → iterate

- **Live preview** — Real-time Markdown rendering (marked.js), code highlighting (highlight.js), diagrams (Mermaid.js)
- **Editor that keeps up** — Native `NSTextView` editing with 40+ language highlighting, bidirectional scroll sync, find & replace, Quick Open (⌘P), tabs, and an FSEvents-driven file browser
- **Images land on disk by themselves** — ⌘V a screenshot or drag an image in; it's saved to `assets/` and inserted as a relative path
- **Local history snapshots** — Every save keeps a snapshot with tiered retention; File History (⌃⌘H) diffs any two versions and restores in one click — and the restore itself is undoable
- **Global search (⌘⇧F)**, TOC outline, tab context menus (close others / reveal in Finder / save as template), and Quick Look previews from Finder
- **Todo inbox** — Collect tasks in a sidebar with calendar & week timeline views (EventKit-backed)

### 🚀 Deliver & share

- **LAN share** — Built-in HTTP server with one-time token auth; one-click **Gist** publishing too
- **Online publish** — One-click publish via Cloudflare. Hosted free tier: 20 docs/month per token, links expire after 30 days; Pro (early access) removes both limits
- **iOS companion** — Edit, chat, and publish over iCloud from your phone
- **Presentation & focus modes**, HTML / PDF / 2× PNG export, preview themes (GitHub / Nord / Dracula)
- **Pre-flight export checks** — PDF/HTML export first diagnoses dead links, missing images, and heading problems (can be turned off in Settings)
- **PDF export themes** — Paper size, margins, header/footer, and an optional cover page; the default export keeps links clickable
- **Copy as rich text** — ⌥⌘C copies rendered formatting, ready to paste into Feishu or email
- **Auto-update** via Sparkle — grab builds from [meditorapp.pages.dev](https://meditorapp.pages.dev)

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS** 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- **Xcode** 15.0+ (for development)
- **Swift** 5.9+

## 🔧 Build & Run

### Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/retrychx/Meditor.git
cd Meditor
swift build
swift run
```

### Run tests

```bash
./scripts/test.sh   # uses full Xcode toolchain
make test           # short alias
```

### Create a .app bundle

```bash
bash scripts/bundle.sh          # builds both arches and creates a Universal .app
open .build/debug/MEditor.app
```

The bundle script compiles `arm64` + `x86_64` and `lipo`s them into a single
Universal binary, so the app runs natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

> The `.app` is ad-hoc signed automatically. After first launch, associate `.md`/`.html` files via **Get Info → Open With → MEditor → Change All**.

### Versioning

The app version has a single source of truth per platform — **this is where you change it**:

- **macOS**: edit [`VERSION`](VERSION) at the repo root. `scripts/bundle.sh` injects it into `MEditor.app`'s `Info.plist` at packaging time (the version keys in `Sources/MEditor/Info.plist` are placeholders).
- **iOS**: edit `MARKETING_VERSION` / `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `Mobile/MEditorMobile.xcodeproj` (target build settings). `Mobile/MEditorMobile/Info.plist` references them as `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` / `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`.

Run `make version` to see the current version and these pointers.

### Open in Xcode

```bash
open Package.swift
```

## ⚙️ AI Setup

Open **Settings (⌘,) → AI** and pick a backend:

| Backend | What you need |
|---------|---------------|
| Built-in preset | Pick one of the 9 presets (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, OpenRouter, Groq, Ollama), paste your API key, pick a model |
| Claude CLI | Nothing — reuses your local Claude Code login |
| Custom endpoint | Any OpenAI-compatible Base URL + key + model |

No key? The Claude CLI backend gets you running with zero configuration.

### MCP server (Claude Desktop, Cursor, …)

MEditor ships a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server over stdio, so external agents can operate on a workspace through the same tool layer the in-app Agent uses (file read/write/patch, directory listing, workspace search, sandboxed shell commands — 12 tools; UI-dependent tools like `open_file` / `insert_at_cursor` are not exposed headlessly).

Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meditor": {
      "command": "/Applications/MEditor.app/Contents/MacOS/MEditor",
      "args": ["mcp", "--workspace", "/path/to/your/workspace"]
    }
  }
}
```

`--workspace` defaults to the current directory if omitted. Shell commands go through the same risk-tiered sandbox as the in-app Agent: BLOCKED commands are always rejected; WARN-level commands (e.g. `git push`, `mv`) are rejected by default in headless mode — add `--allow-warn-commands` to opt in.
